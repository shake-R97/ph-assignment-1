                    envision our social life. We have to free our mind, imagine what has never happened before and write
                    social fiction. We need to imagine things to make them happen. If you don't imagine, it will never
                    happen. Unprecedented technological capabilities combined with unlimited human creativity have given
                    us tremendous power to take on intractable problems like poverty, unemployment, disease, and
                    environmental degradation. Our challenge is to translate this extraordinary potential into
                    meaningful change.There are cultural issues everywhere - in Bangladesh, Latin America, Africa,
                    wherever you go. But somehow when we talk about cultural differences, we magnify those
                    differences.Long live Grameen Bank. Let the power of poor women prevail.
